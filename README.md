# Versatile Accelerated Digital Encryption Recovery
This project details the implementation of a classic Secure hash algorithm-256 algorithm on a Xilinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA), specifically looking at its performance in the recovery process of passwords. The project includes a report with a brief history of the SHA-256, and password recovery presented together with existing solutions to the recovery of passwords. Thereafter, the implementation includes Verilog code, eventually leading to a simple prototype of a Versatile Accelerated Digital Encryption Recovery (VADER) system. A ‘golden measure’ is also developed, which runs on an intel CPU core on Python. By contrasting these two approaches, a thorough analysis of the advantages and drawbacks of hardware acceleration in this context is explored looking at a range of factors, including power consumption, efficiency, and cost. Through these analyses, it is concluded that the FPGA offers an attractive solution to passwords, boasting benefits of scalability, reconfigurability, and high parallelization.
